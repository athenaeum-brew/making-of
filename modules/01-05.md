# Modules 1-5 - Introduction to Java Programming

## Modules 1 to 3 - Introduction to Java Syntax and Basics of Object-Oriented Programming

### Module 1 - Lecture: Basic Java Programming

* Introduction to Java Programming
* Overview of Java language and its features
* Setting up Java development environment
* Basics of Java syntax: variables, data types, operators, and expressions
* Understanding control flow structures: if-else, switch-case, loops
* Understanding OOP concepts: classes, interfaces, objects, methods, and attributes

### Modules 2 - Hands-On Session: "Hello, World!"

* Writing Your First Java Program
* Creating a simple Java application to demonstrate basic syntax and concepts
* Compiling and running Java programs using command-line tools or an IDE
* Implementing Simple Classes, Interfaces and Objects
* Defining methods, constructors, and instance variables

### Module 3 - Lecture: Exception Handling and File I/O

* Introduction to exceptions: what they are and why they are important
* Types of exceptions in Java: checked exceptions, unchecked exceptions, runtime exceptions, and errors
* Exception handling strategies: try-catch blocks, finally block, and exception propagation
* Introduction to file input/output (I/O) operations in Java: reading from and writing to files
* Exception handling techniques for file I/O operations: using try-with-resources for automatic resource management

## Module 4 & 5: Object-Oriented Design Principles - Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism

### Module 4 - Lecture: Object-Orientation

* Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Encapsulation: hiding implementation details and exposing interfaces
* Understanding inheritance and its benefits for code reuse and extensibility
* Polymorphism: understanding method overriding and dynamic method dispatch

### Mdoule 5 - Hands-On Session

* Creating and extending classes to demonstrate inheritance relationships
* Implementing polymorphic behavior through method overriding
