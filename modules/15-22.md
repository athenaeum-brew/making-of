# Modules 15-22 Asynchronous programming

#### Module 15: Introduction to Concurrency

- *Concurrency Concepts*: Explains the differences between parallel, concurrent, asynchronous, and multithreaded programming.
- *Reasons for Concurrency*: Lists benefits such as performance improvement, better responsiveness, efficient resource utilization, handling real-time data, and the necessity due to framework constraints.
- *Performance Demonstration*: Describes a Java program comparing sequential and parallel sum calculations.
- *Concurrency Challenges*: Identifies race conditions and deadlocks as major issues, and suggests strategies like synchronization, robust exception handling, and best practices like avoiding shared mutable state and failing fast.
- *Concurrency Tools and Techniques*: Details synchronization primitives (e.g., locks, semaphores, atomic operations), thread-safe data structures (immutable objects, copy-on-write collections), and thread-local variables for managing concurrent execution.
