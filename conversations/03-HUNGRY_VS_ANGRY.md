You could certainly use "angry" to complete the sentence, especially if you tend to get irritable or easily frustrated when you're hungry. However, the more common expression is "hungry" because it directly relates to the physical sensation of needing food. Additionally, "angry" might imply a more emotional response, while "hungry" specifically addresses the physical need for nourishment. Ultimately, both options could work depending on the context and the individual's feelings at the time.
