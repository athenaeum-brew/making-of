## Collections, Generics, and Streams

<div class='me'></div>

→ I have to give three lectures on the following java arguments : generics, collections (api), and streams. I wonder what is the best order ?

← 
- **Generics**: Start with generics as they form the foundation for understanding collections and streams in Java. Generics allow you to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate with types specified at compile time. Cover topics like generic classes, generic methods, type bounds, wildcard types, and type erasure.

- **Collections API**: Once your audience has a good grasp of generics, move on to the Collections API. Collections provide a way to organize and manipulate groups of objects. Cover topics such as lists, sets, maps, iterators, comparators, and algorithms available in the Collections framework. You can also discuss common data structures like ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeMap, etc.

- **Streams**: Finally, introduce streams as they build upon the concepts of collections and generics. Streams provide a modern, functional-style approach to processing collections of elements. Cover topics such as stream creation, intermediate and terminal operations, parallel streams, and stream collectors. Emphasize the benefits of using streams for concise and readable code.

This order allows you to build upon each topic, starting with the fundamental concepts of generics, then moving to collections which apply generics extensively, and finally introducing streams which leverage collections and offer a more functional programming style.

→ Do you know when these three topics have been introduced in Java ?

<div class='chatGPT'></div>

← Yes, I can provide a brief overview of when these three topics were introduced in Java:

- **Collections API**: *1998*
<br>The Collections Framework has been a part of Java since its early versions. However, significant enhancements were made in Java 2 (JDK 1.2) released in December 1998. This update introduced the java.util package, including interfaces like List, Set, Map, and classes implementing these interfaces like ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap, etc. Further enhancements were made in subsequent versions.

- **Generics**: *2004*
<br>Introduced in Java 5 (also known as J2SE 5.0) released in September 2004. Generics were added to provide compile-time type safety for collections and to enable the creation of generic classes, interfaces, and methods.

- **Streams**: *2014*
<br>Streams were introduced in Java 8, which was released in March 2014. Java 8 introduced the java.util.stream package, providing a modern, functional-style approach to processing collections. Streams enable you to perform bulk operations on collections in a concise and declarative manner, bringing functional programming concepts to Java.
