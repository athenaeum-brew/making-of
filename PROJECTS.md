Implement and visualize at least three different sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort).
Allow users to input a list of numbers to be sorted.
Visualize the sorting process step-by-step using simple HTML/CSS animations.
Provide a brief explanation of each algorithm and its time complexity.

Bubble Sort
Quick Sort
Merge Sort
UI:

HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the front end.
Java HTTP server to handle sorting logic.
2. Pathfinding Algorithm Simulator
Description:
Develop a web application that simulates pathfinding algorithms on a grid. This project will help students understand how pathfinding algorithms work in a visual and interactive manner.

Features:

Implement and visualize at least two pathfinding algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* Algorithm).
Allow users to create a grid with obstacles.
Enable users to set start and end points on the grid.
Visualize the pathfinding process using simple HTML/CSS animations.

3. Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations
Description:
Create a web application that demonstrates the operations of a binary search tree. This will help students understand tree structures and how they can be used to store and retrieve data efficiently.

Features:

Implement insertion, deletion, and search operations in a BST.
Visualize the BST structure after each operation.
Allow users to input values to be inserted, deleted, or searched.
Display in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals of the tree using simple HTML/CSS diagrams.

Allow users to input a range and generate prime numbers within that range.
Visualize the generation process using simple HTML/CSS.
Display the list of generated prime numbers.
Algorithm:

Additional Guidelines for Projects:
Documentation: Ensure each project includes basic documentation for the code and user interface.
Collaboration: Encourage students to work in pairs to foster collaboration and idea exchange.
Extensions: Allow students to propose small extensions or additional features to these projects if they have extra time and interest.
These projects are now simplified and focused on using HTTP applications, making them more suitable for beginners and manageable within the given time frame.
