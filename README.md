## Details

#### Java Programming Crash Course

The Java Programming Crash Course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts of Java programming. It covers a wide range of topics, including Java syntax, data types, control structures, methods, and classes. Students will gain a solid understanding of the core building blocks of the Java language, enabling them to write simple to moderately complex programs. Additionally, the course delves into object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Students will learn how to design and implement classes, utilize inheritance to create hierarchical relationships between classes, and leverage polymorphism for flexible and extensible code. Furthermore, the course explores exception handling techniques to manage errors and file input/output operations for reading from and writing to files. By the end of the course, students will have a strong foundation in Java programming, equipped with the skills necessary to tackle more advanced topics in Java development.

#### Basic UI

The Basic UI module introduces students to the fundamental concepts of user interface (UI) development in Java. The module begins by covering basic UI concepts using the command-line interface (CLI), familiarizing students with textual input/output and simple interaction mechanisms. Students will learn how to accept user input and display information on the console. Building upon this foundation, the module then transitions to exploring JavaFX, a powerful UI toolkit for building rich desktop applications. Students will be introduced to the JavaFX framework and its components, learning how to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with interactive elements. Additionally, the module covers the integration of WebView, allowing students to embed web content within JavaFX applications. Through hands-on exercises and practical examples, students will gain valuable experience in designing and developing basic UIs using both command-line and JavaFX environments.

#### Java Streams

Java Streams provide a powerful and expressive way to process collections of data in a functional style. Instead of manually iterating over collections, Streams allow developers to perform aggregate operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing in a concise and efficient manner. Streams promote functional programming paradigms, enabling developers to write cleaner, more maintainable code. They are particularly useful for handling large datasets or performing complex transformations on collections.

#### Java Generics

Java Generics allow developers to write reusable and type-safe code by parameterizing types and methods. They enable the creation of classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on a range of data types while maintaining type safety at compile time. Generics improve code readability and maintainability by reducing the need for casting and providing compile-time type checking. They are commonly used in collections frameworks, algorithms, and APIs to create flexible and generic components that work with different data types seamlessly.

#### Advanced UI

The Advanced UI module delves into the intricacies of developing advanced user interfaces (UIs) in Java, focusing on web-based applications and responsive design. The module begins by exploring Java as a web server, utilizing technologies such as Apache Tomcat to deploy Java web applications. Students will learn about server-side programming techniques, including handling HTTP requests and responses, managing sessions, and implementing security measures. The module also covers JavaServer Pages (JSPs) as a dynamic web content generation technology, enabling students to create dynamic and interactive web pages that seamlessly integrate Java code. Building upon this foundation, the module introduces the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern for organizing and structuring web applications, promoting code maintainability and scalability. Additionally, students will explore Java as a REST server, implementing RESTful APIs to facilitate communication between client and server applications. The module culminates in a discussion of non-blocking IO and vert.x, introducing students to asynchronous event-driven programming paradigms for building highly scalable and responsive web applications. Through hands-on projects and real-world examples, students will gain practical experience in designing and implementing advanced UIs using Java technologies.

#### Asynchronous Programming

The Asynchronous Programming module delves into the principles and techniques of parallel and asynchronous programming in Java, enabling students to develop efficient and responsive software applications. The module begins by exploring parallel programming with threads, allowing students to harness the power of multi-threading for concurrent execution of tasks. Students will learn how to create and manage threads, synchronize access to shared resources, and coordinate thread activities to prevent race conditions and ensure thread safety. Building upon this foundation, the module delves into advanced synchronization and communication concepts, including locks, semaphores, and condition variables, for coordinating interactions between concurrent threads. Additionally, students will explore input and output operations via streams in asynchronous contexts, leveraging non-blocking IO techniques to achieve high throughput and responsiveness in IO-bound applications. Through hands-on exercises and practical examples, students will gain proficiency in designing and implementing asynchronous programs in Java, capable of handling concurrent tasks efficiently and effectively.

#### Class Libraries and External Libraries

The Class Libraries and External Libraries module explores the utilization of pre-existing libraries to enhance Java applications. Students will learn how to leverage class libraries, which are collections of reusable classes and methods, to expedite development and add functionality to their programs. The module covers common Java class libraries, such as the Java Standard Library (java.lang, java.util, etc.), as well as third-party libraries available through repositories like Maven. Students will understand the importance of selecting appropriate libraries based on project requirements and learn best practices for integrating them into their codebase. Additionally, the module addresses concepts like dependency management, version control, and documentation retrieval for external libraries. Through hands-on exercises and real-world examples, students will gain proficiency in navigating, importing, and effectively utilizing class libraries and external dependencies in their Java projects.

#### Integration of ChatGPT as a Learning Tool

The Integration of ChatGPT as a Learning Tool module introduces students to the innovative use of conversational AI technology to enhance learning experiences in programming courses. Students will explore the integration of ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot developed by OpenAI, as a supplementary learning tool alongside traditional instruction methods. The module demonstrates how ChatGPT can provide personalized assistance, answer questions, provide explanations, and offer guidance on programming concepts and problem-solving strategies. Students will learn how to interact with ChatGPT through natural language conversation, allowing them to seek clarification, receive feedback, and deepen their understanding of course material in a conversational manner. Through interactive demonstrations and hands-on activities, students will gain practical experience in leveraging ChatGPT as a valuable resource for learning and mastering Java programming concepts.
