#### Installing OpenJDK

To start developing Java applications, you can install the OpenJDK (Open Java Development Kit) on your system. OpenJDK is a free and open-source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE), maintained by the open-source community.

#### Steps to Install OpenJDK:

1. **Download OpenJDK**: Visit the official OpenJDK website to [download the latest version](https://jdk.java.net/22/) of the OpenJDK installer for your operating system. Make sure to download the appropriate version for your platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).
1. **Run Installer**: Once the installer is downloaded, run the executable file and follow the installation wizard prompts.
1. **Accept License Agreement**: During the installation process, you may be prompted to accept the OpenJDK license agreement. Read through the terms and conditions, and if you agree, proceed with the installation.
1. **Choose Installation Directory**: Choose the directory where you want to install OpenJDK. The default installation directory is usually fine for most users.
1. **Set Environment Variables (Optional)**: After installation, you may need to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the OpenJDK installation directory. This step is necessary for some development tools and frameworks to locate OpenJDK.
1. **Verify Installation**: Once the installation is complete, open a command prompt or terminal window and type java -version to verify that OpenJDK is installed correctly. You should see the installed version of OpenJDK printed in the output.

#### Exercise 1: "Hello, World!"

*Task*: Write and run a Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

*Solution*: [HelloWorld.java](/samples/01/HelloWorld.java)

#### Exercise 2: Implementing a Simple Class

*Task*: Create a simple Java class called Person with instance variables for name and age. 
      Implement a method introduce() that prints a message introducing the person with their name and age.
      Run a program that instantiate an object of class Person and call the introduce() method on it.

*Solution*: [SimpleClass.java](/samples/01/SimpleClass.java)

####Â Exercise 3: Using Collection Classes

*Task*: Write a Java program that simulates a guest list for a party using a LinkedList to store and manipulate a list of guests invited to the party.

*Instructions - Create a program that*:

- Declares a List of Strings to represent the guest list for the party. Instantiate a LinkedList<String> concrete class.
- Adds several names of guests to the list using the add method.
- Prints out the list of guests invited to the party using a loop to iterate through the list.
- Performs at least one operation on the list, such as removing a guest using the remove method, and prints a message indicating the removed guest.
- Checks if a specific guest is present in the list using the contains method and prints a corresponding message.


*Warning*: Please note that while it's possible to complete this exercise without using generics, that is, with a mere `LinkedList` instead of `LinkedList<Strings>` (generics are the subject of a later module), using raw types may generate warnings in the IDE.

*Solution*: [PartyGuestList.java](/samples/01/PartyGuestList.java)

#### Configuring Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for Java Development

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular and lightweight code editor with built-in support for Java development through extensions. Follow these steps to configure VS Code for Java development:

#### Steps to Configure VS Code:

This assumes that you have completed the first section, [Installing OpenJDK](#installingopenjdk).

* **Install Visual Studio Code**: Download and install Visual Studio Code from [the official website ](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
* **Install Java Extension Pack**: Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar. Search for "Java Extension Pack" and install it. This extension pack includes essential tools and extensions for Java development in VS Code.
* **Configure Java Home**: In Visual Studio Code, open the settings by clicking on File > Preferences > Settings. Search for "Java Home" in the settings search bar. Set the path to your OpenJDK installation directory in the java.home field.
* **Create a Java Project**: Open VS Code and create a new Java project or open an existing one. You can create a new Java project by selecting "Java: Create Java Project" from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and following the prompts.
* **Write and Run Java Code**: Start writing Java code in VS Code by creating Java files with the .java extension. You can use the integrated terminal to compile and run your Java programs. Use commands like javac to compile Java source files and java to execute the compiled bytecode.

Task: Run the programs from exercices [1](#exercise1helloworld), [2](#exercise2implementingasimpleclass) and [3](#exercise3usinginterfacesandobjects) in Visual Code.
