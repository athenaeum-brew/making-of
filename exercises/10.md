### Exercise 4: Stream Processing of Generic Collections from Command-line Input

Create a Java program that takes command-line input to build a generic collection of elements and then performs stream operations on it.

Tasks:
- Define a generic class called DataProcessor that has a method to process a collection of elements using streams. The class should be parameterized with the type of elements it will process.
- In the main method, read command-line input to determine 1. the type of elements to be processed and 2. the number of elements to input.
- Prompt the user to input elements of the specified type. Store these elements in a collection (e.g., ArrayList).
- Create an instance of DataProcessor with the collection of elements and perform stream operations:
- Filter out any elements that satisfy a given condition.
- Transform the remaining elements using a mapping function.
- Collect the transformed elements into a new collection.
- Print the original and transformed collections.

Example:

javac StreamProcessingApp.java && java StreamProcessingApp Integer 3
```bash
Input:
10
20
30
Output:
Original Collection: [10, 20, 30]
Transformed Collection: [100, 400, 900]
```

javac StreamProcessingApp.java && java StreamProcessingApp String 2
```bash
Input:
"Helen"
"Achilles"

Output:
Original Collection: ["Helen", "Achilles"]
Transformed Collection: ["Hello, Helen!", "Hello, Achilles!"]
```

Optional Additional Requirements:

- Handle invalid input gracefully (e.g., non-numeric input for Integer type).
