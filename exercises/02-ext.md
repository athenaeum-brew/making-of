####Â Exercise 3: Using Collection Classes

*Task*: Write a Java program that simulates a guest list for a party using a LinkedList to store and manipulate a list of guests invited to the party.

*Instructions - Create a program that*:

- Declares a List of Strings to represent the guest list for the party. Instantiate a LinkedList<String> concrete class.
- Adds several names of guests to the list using the add method.
- Prints out the list of guests invited to the party using a loop to iterate through the list.
- Performs at least one operation on the list, such as removing a guest using the remove method, and prints a message indicating the removed guest.
- Checks if a specific guest is present in the list using the contains method and prints a corresponding message.


*Warning*: Please note that while it's possible to complete this exercise without using generics, that is, with a mere `LinkedList` instead of `LinkedList<Strings>` (generics are the subject of a later module), using raw types may generate warnings in the IDE.

*Solution*: [PartyGuestList.java](/samples/01/PartyGuestList.java)
