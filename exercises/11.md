### Exercise: Collaborative Artifact Sharing in Maven using GitHub

#### Objectives
- Understand how to read and write Maven artifacts using a custom GitHub Packages repository.
- Learn how to create and configure a GitHub authentication token for Maven.

### Prerequisites
- You need to have a GitHub account.
- Ensure that you are a member of the **athenaeum-brew** organization on GitHub.

#### Step 1: Join the Organization
- Ensure that all students are members of the **athenaeum-brew** organization on GitHub. They need access to the GitHub Packages repository.

#### Step 2: Create a GitHub Authentication Token
1. **Log in to GitHub**: Navigate to your GitHub account.
2. **Go to Settings**: Click on your profile picture in the upper right corner and select "Settings."
3. **Developer settings**: Scroll down and click on "Developer settings."
4. **Personal access tokens**: Click on "Personal access tokens" on the left sidebar, then use "Tokens (classic)".
5. **Generate new token**:
   - Click "Generate new token."
   - Give the token a name (e.g., "Athenaeum-brew Maven Repo").
   - Set the expiration date according to your preference.
   - Select the following scopes:
     - `read:packages` (for reading from the repository)
     - `write:packages` (for writing to the repository)
   - Click "Generate token" and copy the token. **Note:** This is the only time you will see the token.

#### Step 3: Set Up the Token in Maven
- Open or create the `~/.m2/settings.xml` file (or `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.m2\settings.xml` on Windows).
- Add the following XML configuration to the `settings.xml` file, replacing `<GITHUB_USERNAME>` and `<TOKEN>` with your GitHub username and the generated token:

```xml
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>athenaeum-brew-maven-repo</id>
            <username>GITHUB_USERNAME</username>
            <password>TOKEN</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
```

#### Step 4: Configure the `pom.xml` for Reading and Writing Artifacts
1. **Reading from the custom repository**:
   - Add the repository section in the `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>athenaeum-brew-maven-repo</id>
        <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/athenaeum-brew/maven-repo</url>
        <releases>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
        </releases>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
        </snapshots>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

2. **Writing to the custom repository**:
   - Ensure the distribution management section in the `pom.xml` includes:

```xml
<distributionManagement>
    <repository>
        <id>athenaeum-brew-maven-repo</id>
        <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/athenaeum-brew/maven-repo</url>
    </repository>
</distributionManagement>
```

#### Step 5: Build and Deploy a Sample Maven Project
- Create a simple Maven project (e.g., a basic Java application).
- Ensure the project has a valid `pom.xml` with the above configurations.
- Use the following command to deploy the project to the GitHub Packages repository:

```bash
mvn clean deploy
```

### Step 6: Validate the Deployment

1. **Log In to GitHub**:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to the Organization**:
   - Click on your profile picture in the top right corner of the page to open the dropdown menu.
   - Select **Your organizations**.
   - Click on the **athenaeum-brew** organization from the list.

3. **Access the Packages Section**:
   - In the athenaeum-brew organization page, look for the **Packages** tab. This tab may be located in the header or under a dropdown menu depending on your view.
   - Click on the **Packages** tab to view all the packages available in the organization.

4. **Verify Your Artifact**:
   - In the list of packages, look for the artifact you just deployed. It should be listed with its name and version.
   - Click on your package to view its details, including version history, download options, and any other relevant information.

5. **Confirm the Artifact Details**:
   - Check the details to ensure that the artifact uploaded successfully and includes the expected version and metadata.
