### Exercise: Collaborative Artifact Sharing in Maven using GitHub

#### Objectives
- Understand how to read and write Maven artifacts using a custom GitHub Packages repository.
- Learn how to create and configure a GitHub authentication token for Maven.

### Prerequisites
- You need to have a GitHub account.
- Ensure that you are a member of the **athenaeum-brew** organization on GitHub.

#### Step 1: Join the Organization
- Ensure that all students are members of the **athenaeum-brew** organization on GitHub. They need access to the GitHub Packages repository.

#### Step 2: Create a GitHub Authentication Token
1. **Log in to GitHub**: Navigate to your GitHub account.
2. **Go to Settings**: Click on your profile picture in the upper right corner and select "Settings."
3. **Developer settings**: Scroll down and click on "Developer settings."
4. **Personal access tokens**: Click on "Personal access tokens" on the left sidebar, then use "Tokens (classic)".
5. **Generate new token**:
   - Click "Generate new token."
   - Give the token a name (e.g., "Athenaeum-brew Maven Repo").
   - Set the expiration date according to your preference.
   - Select the following scopes:
     - `read:packages` (for reading from the repository)
     - `write:packages` (for writing to the repository)
   - Click "Generate token" and copy the token. **Note:** This is the only time you will see the token.

#### Step 3: Set Up the Token in Maven
- Open or create the `~/.m2/settings.xml` file (or `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.m2\settings.xml` on Windows).
- Add the following XML configuration to the `settings.xml` file, replacing `<GITHUB_USERNAME>` and `<TOKEN>` with your GitHub username and the generated token:

```xml
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>athenaeum-brew-maven-repo</id>
            <username>GITHUB_USERNAME</username>
            <password>TOKEN</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
```

#### Step 4: Configure the `pom.xml` for Reading and Writing Artifacts
1. **Reading from the custom repository**:
   - Add the repository section in the `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>athenaeum-brew-maven-repo</id>
        <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/athenaeum-brew/maven-repo</url>
        <releases>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
        </releases>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
        </snapshots>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

2. **Writing to the custom repository**:
   - Ensure the distribution management section in the `pom.xml` includes:

```xml
<distributionManagement>
    <repository>
        <id>athenaeum-brew-maven-repo</id>
        <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/athenaeum-brew/maven-repo</url>
    </repository>
</distributionManagement>
```

#### Step 5: Build and Deploy a Sample Maven Project
- Create a simple Maven project (e.g., a basic Java application).
- Ensure the project has a valid `pom.xml` with the above configurations.
- Use the following command to deploy the project to the GitHub Packages repository:

```bash
mvn clean deploy
```

### Step 6: Validate the Deployment

1. **Log In to GitHub**:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to the Organization**:
   - Click on your profile picture in the top right corner of the page to open the dropdown menu.
   - Select **Your organizations**.
   - Click on the **athenaeum-brew** organization from the list.

3. **Access the Packages Section**:
   - In the athenaeum-brew organization page, look for the **Packages** tab. This tab may be located in the header or under a dropdown menu depending on your view.
   - Click on the **Packages** tab to view all the packages available in the organization.

4. **Verify Your Artifact**:
   - In the list of packages, look for the artifact you just deployed. It should be listed with its name and version.
   - Click on your package to view its details, including version history, download options, and any other relevant information.

5. **Confirm the Artifact Details**:
   - Check the details to ensure that the artifact uploaded successfully and includes the expected version and metadata.

Unfortunately, GitHub Packages does not provide a direct web-based interface for browsing the contents of a Maven repository, like some other services (e.g., Nexus or Artifactory) might. Instead, you have to rely on Maven's command-line tools and specific queries to list or fetch the contents.

Here are a few ways you can explore or access the Maven artifacts stored in your GitHub Packages repository:

### 1. **Maven Search Plugin**
You can use the `mvn dependency:resolve` or similar Maven commands to explore the artifacts directly from the command line. This will fetch dependencies from your GitHub Packages repository and let you know which versions and artifacts are available.

### 2. **API Access**
You can use GitHub's API to list package versions, though this doesnâ€™t give you a full directory-like view:
- To list versions of a package, you can use:
   ```
   GET /orgs/{org}/packages/{package_type}/{package_name}/versions
   ```
   [GitHub API reference](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/packages/packages#get-all-package-versions-for-a-package-owned-by-an-organization)

### 3. **GitHub Packages Insights**
You can view details of the artifacts you've published through the GitHub Packages UI:
- Navigate to the **Packages** section of your repository.
- Click on the specific package to see details like version history, files, and the exact artifacts that have been uploaded.

However, this does not provide a full "tree" view of your Maven repository, but it helps you inspect package metadata.

### 4. **Maven Repository URL**
Once a dependency is added to a project and you execute a build (`mvn clean install` or similar), Maven will fetch the necessary dependencies and cache them locally. You can inspect the local repository (`~/.m2/repository`) to see which artifacts have been pulled from the GitHub Packages repository.

# Addendum: Intermediate Mini-Project 

## Project Objective

### Implement the `PasswordValidator` interface to validate a password based on a given criterion.

#### Input

[Github repository for password-validator](https://github.com/athenaeum-brew/password-validator)

#### Deliverables
  1. A JAR file containing your implementation.
    - Jar file should be pushed to maven repo as described in the exercice, but is it not a strict requirement.
  2. A link to GitHub repo (or a Zip file) with source code, unit tests, and a README with a description of your criterion. 
    - At least source code must contain javadoc comments.
    - README format can be any of [plain text, markdown, pdf, latex]. Please do not use exotic formats such as Microsoft Word.
    - NB. Note that zip file, javadoc file, ar any file can also be pushed to maven repo. 

- **Requirements**:
  - Implement the `PasswordValidator` interface.
  - Ensure your JAR file can be executed by the testing program.
  - Include detailed unit tests that verify your password validation logic.
  - Write a README explaining your criterion, and how it ensures security (or creativity).
  - Document your code with Javadoc.
