**e.g. Checked and Unchecked Exceptions**
Analyze the following code snippet:  
```java
import java.io.*;

class ExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            readFile(args[0]);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An IOException was caught: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (RuntimeException e) {
            System.out.println("A RuntimeException was caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    static void readFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName));
        System.out.println("File read successfully");
    }
}
```

**Questions:**  
a. What are the types of exceptions handled in this program? Classify them as checked or unchecked exceptions.  

b. What will happen if no arguments are provided, i.e. the args is a zero-length array ?

c. What will happen if the filename provided as program argument does not exists ?

d. why is the `throws` keyword necessary for the `readFile` method ?

### **Solution**

**a. What are the types of exceptions handled in this program? Classify them as checked or unchecked exceptions.**  
- **IOException**:  
  - This is a **checked exception**.  
  - It must be either handled using a `try-catch` block or declared in the `throws` clause of the method.
- **RuntimeException**:  
  - This is an **unchecked exception**.  
  - It occurs during the program's runtime and does not need to be declared in the `throws` clause.

**b. What will happen if no arguments are provided, i.e. the `args` is a zero-length array?**  
- Attempting to access `args[0]` will throw a `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, which is an **unchecked exception**.  
- Since the program has a `catch (RuntimeException e)` block, this exception will be caught, and the following message will be printed:  
  ```
  A RuntimeException was caught: Index 0 out of bounds for length 0
  ```

**c. What will happen if the filename provided as a program argument does not exist?**  
- The `BufferedReader` constructor will attempt to open the file, which will throw a `java.io.FileNotFoundException` if the file does not exist.  
- This exception is a subclass of `IOException`, so it will be caught by the `catch (IOException e)` block.  
- The following message will be printed:  
  ```
  An IOException was caught: example.txt (No such file or directory)
  ```

**d. Why is the `throws` keyword necessary for the `readFile` method?**  
- The `readFile` method uses the `BufferedReader` constructor, which throws a checked exception (`FileNotFoundException`).  
- Java requires that methods either handle checked exceptions using a `try-catch` block or declare them in the `throws` clause.  
- Without the `throws IOException` declaration, the code would not compile because the compiler enforces proper exception handling for checked exceptions.
