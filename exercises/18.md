**e.g. Checked and Unchecked Exceptions**
Analyze the following code snippet:  
```java
import java.io.*;

class ExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            readFile(args[0]);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An IOException was caught: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (RuntimeException e) {
            System.out.println("A RuntimeException was caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    static void readFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName));
        System.out.println("File read successfully");
    }
}
```

**Questions:**  
a. What are the types of exceptions handled in this program? Classify them as checked or unchecked exceptions.  
b. What will happen if no arguments are provided, i.e. the args is a zero-length array ?
c. What will happen if the filename provided as program argument does not exists ?
d. why is the `throws` keyword necessary for the `readFile` method ?
