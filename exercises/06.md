#### Using Interfaces and Objects

*Task*: Define an interface called Greetable with a method greet() that prints a generic greeting message. 
      Implement the Greetable interface in the Person class and provide a custom implementation for the greet() method.
      Run a program that instanciate an object implementing Greetable interface and call the greet() method on it.

*Solution*: [SimpleInterface.java](/samples/01/SimpleInterface.java)

Here’s an extended version of your exercise that incorporates Java's Collection API. We'll define an interface `Greetable`, implement it in multiple classes, and then create a list of objects that implement `Greetable`. The program will loop through this list and call the `greet()` method for each object.

### Updated Exercise:

**Task:**  
1. Define an interface called `Greetable` with a method `greet()` that prints a greeting message.
2. Implement the `Greetable` interface in multiple classes: `Person`, `Dog`, and `Robot`.
3. Create a list using Java’s `ArrayList` from the Java Collection API that stores objects implementing the `Greetable` interface.
4. Iterate over the list and call the `greet()` method on each object.

*Solution*: [SimpleInterfaceWithCollections.java](/samples/08/SimpleInterfaceWithCollections.java)

### Output:
```
Hello, my name is Alice
Woof! I'm Buddy the dog.
Beep boop! I am model T-800 robot.
```

This exercise illustrates both how to work with interfaces and how to utilize the Java Collection API to store and process a list of objects.
