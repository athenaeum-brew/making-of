2. **Inheritance and Polymorphism** 
   Given the class structure below, identify what will be printed when the `main` method is executed.  
   ```java
   class Parent {
       void display() {
           System.out.println("Parent");
       }
   }
   class Child extends Parent {
       void display() {
           System.out.println("Child");
       }
   }
   public class Test {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Parent obj = new Child();
           obj.display();
       }
   }
   ```
   Explain the role of method overriding and polymorphism in the above code.

2. **Inheritance and Polymorphism** 
   Then identify what will be printed when the `main` method below is executed.  
   ```java
   class Parent {
       static void display() {
           System.out.println("Parent");
       }
   }
   class Child extends Parent {
       static void display() {
           System.out.println("Child");
       }
   }
   public class Test {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Parent obj = new Child();
           obj.display();
       }
   }
   ```
   Explain the difference with the previous example, if any.
   Is there an alternative to obj.display(), that keeps the results of the program unchanged ?
