1. **Inheritance and Polymorphism** 
   Given the class structure below, identify what will be printed when the `main` method is executed.  
   ```java
   class Parent {
       void display() {
           System.out.println("Parent");
       }
   }
   class Child extends Parent {
       void display() {
           System.out.println("Child");
       }
   }
   public class Test {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Parent obj = new Child();
           obj.display();
       }
   }
   ```
   Explain the role of method overriding and polymorphism in the above code.

2. Then identify what will be printed when the `main` method below is executed.  
   ```java
   class Parent {
       static void display() {
           System.out.println("Parent");
       }
   }
   class Child extends Parent {
       static void display() {
           System.out.println("Child");
       }
   }
   public class Test {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Parent obj = new Child();
           obj.display();
       }
   }
   ```
   Explain the difference with the previous example, if any.

   Is it necessary to create a new instance of the Child class to get the same ouput ?

   If it is not, by what can 'obj.display()' be replaced to get the same output ?
