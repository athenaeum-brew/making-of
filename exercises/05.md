#  Exercises - File I/O and Exception Handling

#### File I/O Exercise:

Write a Java program that reads data from a text file named input.txt and writes it to a new file named output.txt. Ensure that the program handles exceptions properly and closes the file streams after use.

#### Exception Handling Exercise:

Create a method named divideNumbers(int a, int b) that takes two integers as input and returns the result of dividing a by b. Handle any potential exceptions that may occur during the division operation and display appropriate error messages to the user.
