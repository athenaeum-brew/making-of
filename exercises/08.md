### Easy Exercise: Create a List of Fruits

**Objective:** Practice using the `ArrayList` class to manage a collection of items.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a new Java class named `FruitList`.
2. Inside the class, create a method named `createFruitList` that:
   - Initializes an `ArrayList<String>` to hold fruit names.
   - Adds the following fruits to the list: `"Apple"`, `"Banana"`, `"Cherry"`, `"Date"`, `"Elderberry"`.
   - Prints the list of fruits to the console.
3. In the `main` method, call the `createFruitList` method.

**Sample Output:**
```
Fruits: [Apple, Banana, Cherry, Date, Elderberry]
```

### Moderate Difficulty Exercise: Implement a Student Management System

**Objective:** Apply knowledge of `Map` and `List` to manage student data.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a new Java class named `StudentManagement`.
2. Define a `Student` class with the following attributes:
   - `String name`
   - `int age`
   - `String id`
   
   Include a constructor and getter methods for each attribute.
   
3. In the `StudentManagement` class, create a method named `manageStudents` that:
   - Initializes a `HashMap<String, List<Student>>` to store students by their grade level (e.g., "Freshman", "Sophomore", "Junior", "Senior").
   - Add the following students to their respective grades:
     - Freshman: Alice (age 18, ID: S001), Bob (age 19, ID: S002)
     - Sophomore: Charlie (age 20, ID: S003)
     - Junior: David (age 21, ID: S004), Eva (age 22, ID: S005)
   - Print out the names of students in each grade level.

**Sample Output:**
```
Freshman: [Alice, Bob]
Sophomore: [Charlie]
Junior: [David, Eva]
```
