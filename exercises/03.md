### **Exercise 1: Simple Calculator**
**Objective:** Create a simple command-line calculator that takes two integers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

#### **Instructions:**
1. Prompt the user to enter two integers.
2. Ask the user which operation they want to perform: add, subtract, multiply, or divide.
3. Use `Scanner` to read the user's input.
4. Perform the chosen operation and display the result.
5. Handle potential errors, such as division by zero or invalid inputs.

#### **Sample Output:**
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Choose an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide): multiply
Result: 10 * 5 = 50
```

#### **Hints:**
- Use `scanner.nextInt()` to read integers.
- Use `scanner.nextLine()` to read the operation.
- To handle division by zero, you can use an if condition to check for a zero divisor.

### **Exercise 2: Word Counter**
**Objective:** Create a program that reads multiple lines of text from the user and counts the total number of words entered.

#### **Instructions:**
1. Prompt the user to enter text line by line.
2. Continue reading input until the user enters an empty line (just presses "Enter").
3. For each line, count the number of words.
4. After the user finishes input, display the total word count.

#### **Sample Output:**
```
Enter a line of text: Hello world
Enter a line of text: This is a test
Enter a line of text: 
Total word count: 5
```

#### **Hints:**
- Use `scanner.nextLine()` to read each line.
- Split the input into words using the `split(" ")` method.
- Stop the loop when the user enters an empty string (`""`).
