### Rich Client Interface

--

A "Rich Client Interface" is a GUI that enhances user experience through extensive interactivity, visual appeal, and advanced features like multimedia integration, animations, and responsive interactions, aiming to replicate desktop application functionality within web or desktop environments.

- **Visual Appeal**: Utilizes graphics, colors, and typography for aesthetically pleasing designs.
- **Interactivity**: Supports various user interactions like clicking, dragging, typing, and gestures.
- **Multimedia Integration**: Includes images, audio, video, and other multimedia elements to enhance user engagement.
- **Customization**: Offers flexibility in customizing layout, themes, and components based on user preferences.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures smooth and consistent interactions across diverse screen sizes and devices.

#¬†Graphical User Interface

### Brief History of Java "Rich Client Interface" Technologies:

<small>[1996 JDK 1.0]</small> **AWT**, aka Abstract Window Toolkit, was the first GUI toolkit included in the Java Development Kit (JDK) since Java's inception, providing a set of platform-dependent widgets for building GUI applications

--

<small>[1998 JDK 1.2]</small> **Swing** addressed many of the shortcomings of AWT, offering a richer set of GUI components, improved platform independence, and greater flexibility in UI design.

--

<small>[2000 Eclipse]</small>  **SWT**, aka Standard Widget Toolkit, developed by IBM, took a different approach from AWT and Swing by leveraging native widgets provided by the underlying operating system, resulting in better performance and native look and feel.

--

<small>[2008]</small> **JavaFX** is positioned as the successor to Swing, designed to address the evolving needs of modern UI development.
JavaFX offers a rich set of APIs for building desktop, mobile, and web applications with immersive user interfaces.
It provides support for multimedia, 2D and 3D graphics, animations, effects, and a modern declarative UI design language (FXML).

### Hello, World!

```java
public class HelloJavaFXWorld extends Application {

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) {
        // Set the title of the stage to the simple name of the class
        stage.setTitle(this.getClass().getSimpleName());

        // Create a label with a message containing JavaFX and Java versions
        Label label = new Label(String.format("Hello, JavaFX %s, running on Java %s.",
                System.getProperty("javafx.version"), // Retrieve JavaFX version
                System.getProperty("java.version") // Retrieve Java version
        ));

        // Create a StackPane and add the label to it
        StackPane pane = new StackPane(label);

        // Get the primary screen and its visual bounds
        Screen screen = Screen.getPrimary();
        Rectangle2D bounds = screen.getVisualBounds();

        // Create a scene with the StackPane as its root, using the screen bounds
        Scene scene = new Scene(pane, bounds.getWidth(), bounds.getHeight());

        // Set the scene to the stage and display the stage
        stage.setScene(scene);
        stage.show();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Launch the JavaFX application
        launch();
    }
}
