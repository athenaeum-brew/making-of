# Introduction to REST

---

REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications.

Developed by Roy Fielding in his 2000 doctoral dissertation.

RESTful systems use HTTP requests to perform CRUD operations.

---

### REST Principles

- Stateless: Each request from client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
- Client-Server: Separation of client and server logic.
- Cacheable: Responses must define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable.
- Layered System: Architecture composed of hierarchical layers.
- Uniform Interface: Simplifies and decouples the architecture.

### Resources and URIs

- Resources: Any object, data, or service accessible over the web.
- URI (Uniform Resource Identifier): Identifies each resource.
- Example: http://api.example.com/users/123 for user with ID 123.

---

### HTTP Methods

- GET: Retrieve a resource.
- POST: Create a new resource.
- PUT: Update an existing resource.
- DELETE: Remove a resource.
- PATCH: Partially update a resource.

---

### RESTful API Design

- Use nouns for resources, not verbs.
- HTTP methods represent actions.
- Use plural nouns (e.g., /users not /user).
- Provide meaningful error messages.

---

### REST Self-Discovery

HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State): Clients interact with the application entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by application servers.

Links in responses: Provides URLs to navigate the API.

Example: A response for a user might include links to related resources such as their posts or comments.

Benefits: Simplifies client-server interactions and improves scalability and adaptability.

### Benefits of REST

- Scalability: Stateless nature allows better scalability.
- Flexibility: Supports multiple data formats (JSON, XML, etc.).
- Performance: Caching enhances performance.
- Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement.

### Common RESTful Services

- Google Maps API
- Twitter API
- GitHub API
- Facebook Graph API
