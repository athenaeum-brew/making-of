## Functional Programming

**Paradigm**: Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, emphasizing immutable data and avoiding side effects.

--

**Key Concepts**:

- _Pure Functions_: Produce consistent output with no side effects.
- _Immutability_: Immutable data structures enhance clarity and simplicity.
- _Higher-Order Functions_, _First-Class Functions_: Enable function composition and abstraction. Treat functions as data.
- _Lazy Evaluation_: Delayed computation until necessary, improving efficiency.

**Examples**:

- Haskell, Scala, Clojure, Erlang, Lisp

## Java & Functional Programming

Java Streams are indeed an attempt to introduce functional programming concepts into the traditionally object-oriented Java language. Functional programming is a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

Java Streams provide a way to process collections of data in a functional style, allowing developers to perform operations such as map, filter, and reduce on data elements. This approach emphasizes immutability, laziness, and the use of higher-order(\*) functions, which are fundamental principles in functional programming.

<small>(\*) "Higher-order functions" are functions that can either take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. In simpler terms, they are functions that operate on other functions, either by accepting them as parameters or by producing them as return values.</small>

**Functions as parameters**: Methods like map, filter, and reduce in Java Streams accept functions (often referred to as lambda expressions or method references) as arguments. For example, the map method takes a function that specifies how each element of the stream should be transformed.

```java
List<String> words = Arrays.asList("hello", "world");
List<Integer> lengths = words.stream()
                            .map(String::length) // Method reference
                            .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

Demo, to see the result &hellip;

### Intermediate Operations

→ Operations that can be chained together to form a pipeline. These operations transform the stream and produce another stream as output.

- **map**: Transforms each element of the stream according to the provided function.
- **filter**: Filters the elements of the stream based on a predicate.
- **distinct**: Removes duplicate elements from the stream.
- **sorted**: Sorts the elements of the stream based on a comparator.
- **limit**: Limits the size of the stream to a specified number of elements.
- **skip**: Skips a specified number of elements from the beginning of the stream.

```java
List<String> words = Arrays.asList("hello", "world", "java", "programming", "is", "fun");
List<String> filteredWords = words.stream()
                                  .filter(word -> word.length() > 4) // Filter words with length greater than 4
                                  .map(String::toUpperCase) // Transform each remaining word to uppercase
                                  .collect(Collectors.toList());
System.out.println(filteredWords);
```

### Terminal Operations

→ Operations that produce a result or a side effect and terminate the stream. Once a terminal operation is invoked, the stream is consumed, and it cannot be reused.

- **collect**: Collects the elements of the stream into a collection.
- **forEach**: Performs an action for each element of the stream.
- **reduce**: Reduces the elements of the stream to a single value.
- **count**: Returns the count of elements in the stream.
- **anyMatch, allMatch, noneMatch**: Checks if any, all, or none of the elements match a given predicate.

```java
List<String> words = Arrays.asList("hello", "world", "");
long count = words.stream()
                 .filter(word -> word.length() > 5)
                 .count();
System.out.println("Number of words with length > 5: " + count);
```

# Java Streams

### Parallel Streams

→ Parallel streams allow for parallel processing of stream elements, leveraging multiple threads to speed up computation for large datasets.

```java
List<String> words = Arrays.asList("hello", "world");
long count = words.parallelStream()
                 .filter(word -> word.length() > 5)
                 .count();
System.out.println("Number of words with length > 5 (parallel): " + count);
```

**Caution**:

- Parallel streams may not always provide performance improvements and can introduce overhead.
- Operations should be stateless and non-interfering to ensure correctness in parallel execution.

# Java Streams

### Stream Pipeline Optimization

→ Java Streams are designed for optimization to improve performance and reduce memory overhead.

- Fusion: Combining multiple stream operations into a single pass over the data.
- Short-circuiting: Stopping processing as soon as the result can be determined.
- Primitive Specialization: Using specialized streams for primitive data types to avoid boxing/unboxing overhead.

```java
int sum = IntStream.range(1, 100)
                   .filter(x -> x % 2 == 0)
                   .map(x -> x * x)
                   .sum();
```

In this example, fusion occurs because the filter, map, and sum operations are fused into a single pass over the stream of integers.

The Java compiler, along with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), can perform certain optimizations automatically, including fusion of stream operations.

### Error Handling

Java Streams provide mechanisms for handling errors during stream processing.

- try-catch: Wrap stream operations in try-catch blocks to handle checked exceptions.
- Exception Translation: Convert checked exceptions to unchecked exceptions using RuntimeException or UncaughtExceptionHandler.
- Optional: Use Optional to handle potential null values returned by stream operations.

```java
Stream.of("file.txt")
    .map(path -> {
        try {
            return Files.lines(Paths.get(path));
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle the IOException by returning an empty stream
            System.err.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
            return Stream.empty();
        }
    })
    .forEach(System.out::println);
```

### Integration with Collections

Java Streams seamlessly integrate with collections, allowing for easy conversion between collections and streams.

```java
List<String> words = Arrays.asList("hello", "world");

Stream<String> stream = words.stream(); // Collection to Stream

List<String> collectedWords = stream.collect(Collectors.toList()); // Stream to Collection
```

- Enables functional-style processing of collections.
- Facilitates interoperability with existing code that uses collections.

## Demo

```java
public class StreamProcessingApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Enter things (press Enter after each thing, press CTRL-D to end):");
        try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)) {
            // to count tokens, we need an integer container (as lambda can only access final)
            final int[] count = new int[] { 0 };            
            scanner // Set delimiter to newline
                    .useDelimiter("\\n") 
                    // Get stream of tokens
                    .tokens()
                    // Filter out empty tokens
                    .filter(token -> !token.trim().isEmpty())
                    .map(token -> { try {
                                        // Attempt to parse the token as a number
                                        double number = Double.parseDouble(token);
                                        return number * number;
                                    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
                                        // If parsing fails, treat the token as a string
                                        return String.format("Hello, %s!", token);
                                    }})
                    // Increment count for each token processed
                    .peek(token -> count[0]++)
                    // Print token count
                    .forEach(token -> System.out.printf("%d - %s - %s", count[0],
                                                                        token.getClass(),
                                                                        token));
            // Print the count at the end
            System.out.printf("Number of tokens treated: %d%n", count[0]);
        }
    }
}
```
