        <h1>Synchronization Primitives</h1>
        <p>A "synchronization primitive" is a low-level programming construct or mechanism used to coordinate the execution of multiple threads or processes in a concurrent system.
            These primitives are fundamental tools for ensuring that concurrent operations occur in a controlled and orderly manner, preventing race conditions, data corruption,
            and other concurrency-related issues.</p>

        <h2>Common Synchronization Primitives:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mutexes (Mutual Exclusion)</strong>: Mutexes allow only one thread at a time to access a shared resource, ensuring that only one thread can execute a
                critical section of code while others are blocked. This prevents concurrent access to shared resources, avoiding conflicts.</li>
            <li><strong>Semaphores</strong>: Semaphores are integer variables used for signaling between processes or threads. They can be used to control access to a pool of
                resources, limiting the number of threads that can access them simultaneously.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitors</strong>: Monitors are high-level synchronization constructs that encapsulate shared data and the operations that can be performed on it. They
                provide mutual exclusion and condition synchronization mechanisms, making it easier to write concurrent programs by abstracting away low-level details.</li>
            <li><strong>Condition Variables</strong>: Condition variables are synchronization primitives used to coordinate threads based on specific conditions. Threads can wait
                for a condition to become true before proceeding with their execution.</li>
            <li><strong>Barriers</strong>: Barriers synchronize a group of threads, forcing them to wait until all threads in the group have reached a certain point in the program
                before allowing any of them to proceed further.</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Operations</strong>: Atomic operations ensure that certain operations on shared data are executed atomically, without interruption, thereby avoiding
                race conditions. Examples include compare-and-swap (CAS) and fetch-and-add (FAA) operations.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Synchronization primitives are essential for building concurrent systems that are correct, efficient, and free from race conditions and deadlocks. However, they require
            careful use to avoid pitfalls such as deadlock, livelock, and performance bottlenecks.</p>
