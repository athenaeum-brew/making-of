## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

What is Object-Oriented Programming?

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which encapsulate data and behavior.

Principles of OOP

- Principles of OOP include encapsulation, inheritance, composition, and polymorphism ...

Benefits of using OOP in software development

- ... facilitating modularity, extensibility, and code reuse. Other benefits include improved code organization, easier maintenance and debugging, and better collaboration among developers.

There is no such thing as a free lunch

- The costs associated with Object-Oriented Programming include increased complexity, potential performance overhead, elongated design decision process, steep learning curve, and the potential for over-engineering.

### Use-Case

Let's models a class hierarchy for Greek mythological characters, including mortals, gods, and heroes, with appropriate attributes and behaviors such as name, description, birth and death dates, and wrathfulness, to demonstrates encapsulation, inheritance, composition, polymorphism, and the use of interfaces and abstract classes.

These Object-Oriented Programming Semantics 😉 will be gradually introduced during the development of the use-case.

### UML

*Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized visual modeling language used to specify, visualize, construct, and document the artifacts of a software system.*

*UML is commonly utilized in object-oriented programming (OOP) as a means to represent the structural and behavioral aspects of software systems through diagrams and models, facilitating communication and understanding among developers, stakeholders, and users.*

~~"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." [Genesis - 1]~~

In the beginning Christophe Thiebaud created the 'Being':

![Being Class](/images/0_beings.svg)

```java
class Being {
    // Attributes
    private String name;
    private String description;
    // Constructor
    public Being(String name, String description) {
        this.name = name;
        this.description = description;
    }
    // So-called 'getters', i.e. methods to get the value of attributes (name and description)
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }
}
```

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation in programming refers to bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit or class, thereby controlling access to the data and preventing outside interference. 

By concealing the inner workings of a class and providing only essential access points through well-defined interfaces, encapsulation facilitates modularization and reduces dependencies, promoting easier code maintenance and updates. 

Additionally, encapsulation enhances security by restricting direct access to sensitive data or implementation details, allowing developers to enforce access controls and minimize the risk of unintended modifications or vulnerabilities.

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

Gods and Humans share the same characteristics as Beings, but they also have specific attributes or methods.

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

### Inheritance

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), inheritance is a fundamental concept where a subclass or derived class can inherit attributes and methods from a superclass or base class. 

This mechanism facilitates code reusability and promotes hierarchical organization of classes based on their similarities and differences. 

By extending an existing class, subclasses gain access to the properties and behaviors of their superclass, allowing for specialization by adding new features or overriding existing ones. 

---

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

Gods and Humans are subclasses of Beings.

![Being Class](/images/1_humans-and-gods.svg)

- There is no longer duplication of the name and description attributes and accessors.
- Each subclass has its own specialization.
- Being is now an abstract class.

---

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

Java code for Inheritance: 'extends'

```java
abstract class Being {
    // (...)
    public Being(String name, String description) {
        this.name = name;
        this.description = description;
    }
    // (...)
}
class Human extends Being {
    private final Date birth;
    private Date death;
    public Human(String name, String description, Date birth) {
        super(name, description);
        this.birth = birth;
    }
    public Date getBirth() {
        return birth;
    }
    public Date getDeath() {
        return death;
    }
    public void setDeath(Date death) {
        this.death = death;
    }
}
class God extends Being {
    public void wrath() {
        System.out.println(getName() + " is displaying wrath!");
    }
}
```

### Interfaces

---

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

### Interfaces

Interfaces in object-oriented programming serve as blueprints for classes, defining a set of method signatures without specifying their implementations. 

Through interfaces, developers can establish a contract that classes must adhere to, ensuring consistency and interoperability within a system. 

**Polymorphism**, a key principle in object-oriented design, allows objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably when they share a common interface or superclass.

---

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

Java code for Interfaces: 'implements'

```java
interface Describable {
    String getName();
    String getDescription();
}

interface Mortal {
    Date getBirth();
    Date getDeath();
    void setDeath(Date death);
}

interface Wrath {
    void wrath();
}

```

Implementations

```java
abstract class Being implements Describable {
    (...)
}
class Human extends Being implements Mortal {
    (...)
}
class God extends Being implements Wrath {
    (...)
    @Override
    public void wrath() {
    }
}

```

### Composition

Heroes, Semigods, Legends and Deeds.

![Heroes and SemiGods](/images/3_heroes-semigods-legends-deeds.svg)

<small>
*The legend of Hercules consists of the following deeds:*
- *Killing the Nemean Lion,*
- *Slaying the Lernaean Hydra,*
- *Capturing the Golden Hind, etc.*

*The legend of Achilles consists of the following deeds:*
- *Defeated Hector, the Trojan prince, in single combat,*
- *Led the Myrmidons in battle, etc.*
</small>

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

### Composition 

Composition, as an alternative to inheritance in object-oriented programming, offers a distinct approach to structuring classes and objects. 

Rather than relying on subclassing and extending functionality from a superclass, composition emphasizes building complex objects by combining simpler ones. 

This is achieved by creating classes that contain instances of other classes as member variables, allowing for a more flexible and modular design. With composition, objects can dynamically change their behavior at runtime by modifying the composition of their components. 

This approach promotes code reuse, as components can be shared across different classes without creating deep class hierarchies. 

Furthermore, composition fosters loosely coupled systems, reducing dependencies and making it easier to maintain and extend codebases over time.

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

Java code for Composition: 

```java
class Deed {
    private String name;
    private String description;
    (...)
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }
}
class Legend {
    private final Set<Deed> deeds;
    (...)
    public Set<Deed> getAll() {
        return Collections.unmodifiableSet(deeds);
    }
}
class SemiGod {
    private Legend legend;
    (...)
    Legend getLegend() {
        return this.legend;
    }
}
```

### Multiple Inheritance

![Multiple Inheritance](/images/6_heroes-and-semigods-multiple.svg)

Semi-God (<small>e.g. Hercules, son of Zeus, king of the gods, and the mortal woman Alcmene</small>) inherits attributes and methods from both Humans (e.g. setDeath) and Gods (e.g wrath).

The setDeath method in the SemiGod subclass might want to override the method from its Human parent class to throw an UnsupportedOperationException.

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

### Multiple Inheritance

In Java, multiple inheritance, the ability for a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one superclass, is not directly supported. 

This design choice was made to avoid certain complexities and ambiguities that can arise from multiple inheritance, such as the diamond problem. 

However, developers can achieve similar functionality by using interfaces, which allow classes to implement multiple interfaces and inherit their methods without inheriting state.

#### The Law of Leaky Abstractions

The law of leaky abstractions means that whenever somebody comes up with a wizzy new code-generation tool that is supposed to make us all ever-so-efficient, you hear a lot of people saying “learn how to do it manually first, then use the wizzy tool to save time.” Code generation tools which pretend to abstract out something, like all abstractions, leak, and the only way to deal with the leaks competently is to learn about how the abstractions work and what they are abstracting. So the abstractions save us time working, but they don’t save us time learning.
