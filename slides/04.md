## Object-Oriented Programming

What is Object-Oriented Programming?

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which encapsulate data and behavior.

Principles of OOP

- Principles of OOP include encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, composition, and polymorphism ...

Benefits of using OOP in software development

- ... facilitating modularity, extensibility, and code reuse. Other benefits include improved code organization, easier maintenance and debugging, and better collaboration among developers.

There is no such thing as a free lunch

- The costs associated with Object-Oriented Programming include increased complexity, potential performance overhead, elongated design decision process, steep learning curve, and the potential for over-engineering.

## Object-Oriented Programming

### Use-Case

Let's models a class hierarchy for Greek mythological characters, including mortals, gods, and heroes, with appropriate attributes and behaviors such as name, description, birth and death dates, and wrathfulness, to demonstrates encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, composition, polymorphism, and the use of interfaces and abstract classes.

These Object-Oriented Programming Semantics ðŸ˜‰ will be gradually introduced during the development of the use-case.

### UML

_Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized visual modeling language used to specify, visualize, construct, and document the artifacts of a software system._

_UML is commonly utilized in object-oriented programming (OOP) as a means to represent the structural and behavioral aspects of software systems through diagrams and models, facilitating communication and understanding among developers, stakeholders, and users._

~~"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." [Genesis - 1]~~

In the beginning Christophe Thiebaud created the 'Being':

![Being Class](/images/model/0_beings.svg)

```java
class Being {
    // Attributes
    private String name;
    private String description;
    // Constructor
    public Being(String name, String description) {
        this.name = name;
        this.description = description;
    }
    // Methods
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }
}
```

## Object-Oriented Programming

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation in programming refers to bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit or class, thereby controlling access to the data and preventing outside interference.

By concealing the inner workings of a class and providing only essential access points through well-defined interfaces, encapsulation facilitates modularization and reduces dependencies, promoting easier code maintenance and updates.

Additionally, encapsulation enhances security by restricting direct access to sensitive data or implementation details, allowing developers to enforce access controls and minimize the risk of unintended modifications or vulnerabilities.

## Object-Oriented Programming

Gods and Humans share the same characteristics as Beings, but they also have specific attributes or methods.

## Object-Oriented Programming

### Inheritance

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), inheritance is a fundamental concept where a subclass or derived class can inherit attributes and methods from a superclass or base class.

This mechanism facilitates code reusability and promotes hierarchical organization of classes based on their similarities and differences.

By extending an existing class, subclasses gain access to the properties and behaviors of their superclass, allowing for specialization by adding new features or overriding existing ones.

---

## Object-Oriented Programming

Gods and Humans are subclasses of Beings.

![Being Class](/images/model/2_beings-humans-and-gods.svg)

- There is no longer duplication of the name and description attributes and accessors.
- Each subclass has its own specialization.
- Being is now an abstract class.

---

## Object-Oriented Programming

Java code for Inheritance: 'extends'

```java
abstract class Being {
    // (...)
    public Being(String name, String description) {
        this.name = name;
        this.description = description;
    }
    // (...)
}
class Human extends Being {
    private final Date birth;
    private Date death;
    public Human(String name, String description, Date birth) {
        super(name, description);
        this.birth = birth;
    }
    public Date getBirth() {
        return birth;
    }
    public Date getDeath() {
        return death;
    }
    public void setDeath(Date death) {
        this.death = death;
    }
}
class God extends Being {
    public void wrath() {
        System.out.println(getName() + " is displaying wrath!");
    }
}
```

---

## Object-Oriented Programming

### Abstraction

Encapsulation ensures that the internal state of an object is protected and accessible only through controlled interfaces, but it doesn't necessarily hide all implementation details.

On the other hand, abstraction focuses on simplifying complex systems by emphasizing relevant aspects and ignoring irrelevant details, regardless of how the implementation is encapsulated.

---

## Object-Oriented Programming

### Interfaces

![](/images/model/3_interfaces.svg)

---

## Object-Oriented Programming

### Interfaces

Interfaces in object-oriented programming act as blueprints for classes, specifying a set of method signatures without providing implementations.

Developers use interfaces to establish contracts that classes must follow, ensuring consistency and interoperability within a system.

Programming to interfaces rather than concrete implementations enables abstraction by decoupling the interface from its implementations and emphasizing what objects can do rather than how they do it.

Polymorphism, a fundamental principle in object-oriented design, permits objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably when they share a common interface or superclass.

---

## Object-Oriented Programming

Java code for Interfaces: 'implements'

```java
interface Describable {
    String getName();
    String getDescription();
}

interface Mortal {
    Date getBirth();
    Date getDeath();
    void setDeath(Date death);
}

interface Wrath {
    void wrath();
}

```

Implementations

```java
abstract class Being implements Describable {
    private String name;
    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }
    (...)
}
class Human extends Being implements Mortal {
    (...)
}
class God extends Being implements Wrath {
    (...)
    @Override // <- catch errors at compile time if the annotated method doesn't actually override a method from the superclass
    public void wrath() {
    }
}

```

Heroes, Semigods, Legends and Deeds: **Â Composition**

![Heroes and SemiGods](/images/model/4_heroes-semigods-legends-deeds.svg)

---

## Object-Oriented Programming

###Â Composition

Composition, as an alternative to inheritance in object-oriented programming, offers a distinct approach to structuring classes and objects.

Rather than relying on subclassing and extending functionality from a superclass, composition emphasizes building complex objects by combining simpler ones.

This is achieved by creating classes that contain instances of other classes as member variables, allowing for a more flexible and modular design. With composition, objects can dynamically change their behavior at runtime by modifying the composition of their components.

This approach promotes code reuse, as components can be shared across different classes without creating deep class hierarchies.

Furthermore, composition fosters loosely coupled systems, reducing dependencies and making it easier to maintain and extend codebases over time.

---

## Object-Oriented Programming

Java code for Composition:

```java
class Deed {
    private String name;
    private String description;
    (...)
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }
}
class Legend {
    private final Set<Deed> deeds;
    (...)
    public Set<Deed> getAll() {
        return Collections.unmodifiableSet(deeds);
    }
}
class SemiGod {
    private Legend legend;
    (...)
    Legend getLegend() {
        return this.legend;
    }
}
```

### Multiple Inheritance

![Multiple Inheritance](/images/model/5_heroes-and-semigods-multiple.svg)

Semi-God (<small>e.g. Hercules, son of Zeus, king of the gods, and the mortal woman Alcmene</small>) inherits attributes and methods from both Humans (e.g. setDeath) and Gods (e.g wrath).

The setDeath method in the SemiGod subclass might want to override the method from its Human parent class to throw an UnsupportedOperationException.

## Object-Oriented Programming

### Multiple Inheritance

In Java, multiple inheritance, the ability for a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one superclass, is not directly supported.

This design choice was made to avoid certain complexities and ambiguities that can arise from multiple inheritance, such as the diamond problem.

However, developers can achieve similar functionality by using interfaces, which allow classes to implement multiple interfaces and inherit their methods without inheriting state.

        if (!genderMap.containsValue(true)) { // Check if at least one gender is true
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("At least one gender must be true.");
        }

    public void wrath() {
        // do something terrible
    }
}
class God implements Justice { // Class representing a deity
    @Override
