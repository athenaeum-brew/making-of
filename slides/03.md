# Module 3: File I/O and Exception Handling

## Introduction to File Input/Output (I/O) Operations

#### Overview of file I/O operations in Java:

- File I/O operations involve reading from and writing to files on the disk.
- Java provides classes and interfaces in the java.io and java.nio packages for performing file I/O operations.

#### Reading from files:

- Reading data from files involves opening a file, reading its contents into memory, and processing the data as needed.

#### Writing to files:
- Writing data to files involves opening a file, writing data to it, and closing the file to ensure the data is flushed and persisted to disk.

## Introduction to File Input/Output (I/O) Operations

#### Reading from files:

```java 
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        FileReader fileReader = new FileReader("example-read.txt");
        int data;
        while ((data = fileReader.read()) != -1) {
            System.out.print((char) data);
        }
        System.out.println();
        fileReader.close();
    }
}
```

#### Writing to files:

```java 
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileWriterExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter("example-write.txt");
        fileWriter.write("Hello, File I/O!");
        fileWriter.close();
    }
}
```

```bash
cd samples/01/
javac FileWriterExample.java
java FileWriterExample
```

## Introduction to Exceptions

Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.

They are important for handling unexpected situations and errors gracefully.

Types of exceptions in Java:

- Checked exceptions: These are checked at compile time and must be handled explicitly by the programmer.
- Unchecked exceptions, or Runtime exceptions: These are not checked at compile time and usually indicate programming errors or unexpected conditions.
- Errors: Serious problems that cannot be handled by the application, such as out-of-memory errors or system failures.

## Introduction to Exceptions

#### Exception Handling Strategies

Handling exceptions with try-catch blocks:

- The try-catch block is used to handle exceptions by enclosing the code that might throw an exception within a try block and providing catch blocks to handle specific types of exceptions.

The finally block for cleanup and resource management:

- The finally block is used to execute cleanup code that should be run regardless of whether an exception occurs or not, such as releasing resources or closing files.

Exception propagation: how exceptions propagate through method calls:

- When an exception is thrown inside a method, it can be propagated up the call stack to the calling method if not caught and handled locally. This allows for centralized exception handling at higher levels of the application.

## Exception Handling Techniques for File I/O

#### Reading from files and Handling Exceptions:

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReaderExampleWithExceptions {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BufferedReader reader = null;
        try {
            reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("example-read.txt"));
            int data;
            while ((data = reader.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) data);
            }
            System.out.println();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // e.printStackTrace();
            System.out.println("Here I MUST handle the exception !");
        } finally {
            if (reader != null) {
                try {
                    reader.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Note how resources management is cumbersome.

## Exception Handling Techniques for File I/O

#### Reading from files and Handling Exceptions

Best practices for handling exceptions in file I/O operations:
  - Using try-with-resources for automatic resource management

```java
public class FileReaderExampleWithExceptions {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("example-read.txt"))) {
            int data;
            while ((data = reader.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) data);
            }
            System.out.println();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
