## Introduction to Java Generics

What are generics?

Java generics enable type-safe programming with parameterized types, allowing developers to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on a range of data types while maintaining type safety at compile time.

## Why Use Generics?

Generics promote code reusability and type safety, improving software quality by reducing the need for explicit type casting and providing compile-time type checking, thereby minimizing runtime errors and enhancing overall robustness.

### Generic Classes

Generic classes allow the creation of type-generic data structures and algorithms, enabling developers to write reusable components that can work with different types while maintaining type safety and avoiding code duplication.

### Generic Methods

Generic methods enable writing methods that operate on parameters of any type, enhancing code flexibility and reducing redundancy by allowing the same method to work with different types of data.

### Type Parameters and Constraints

Type parameters define the types that a generic class or method can work with, allowing developers to specify constraints on the types that can be used, such as specifying a superclass or an interface that the type must implement.

### Type Erasure

Java generics use type erasure to ensure backward compatibility with pre-existing code, where type information is erased at runtime, allowing generic code to interact seamlessly with non-generic code while still providing compile-time type safety.

### Avoiding Type Casting

Generics eliminate the need for explicit type casting, reducing runtime errors and enhancing code readability by allowing developers to work with data in a type-safe manner without the risk of type mismatches.

### Compile-Time Type Safety

Java compiler checks types at compile time, ensuring type safety with generics by detecting and preventing type errors before the code is executed, thereby reducing the likelihood of runtime exceptions and improving overall code quality.

### Generic Interfaces

Generic interfaces define behavior for classes with specified type parameters, providing a flexible and reusable way to define contracts for classes that work with different types of data.

### Wildcards in Generics

Wildcard types allow for greater flexibility in working with unknown types, enabling developers to write generic code that can accept a range of related types without being overly restrictive or specific.

### Generics and Subtyping

Generics support subtyping relationships, allowing for more generic behavior by enabling subclasses to be used in place of their superclass in generic code, enhancing code flexibility and reusability.

### Generics in Collections

Generics enhance type safety and readability in Java collection classes, allowing developers to specify the types of elements stored in collections and ensuring that only compatible types can be added to or retrieved from collections.
