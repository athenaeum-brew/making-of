##Â Introduction to Generics

What are generics?

Generics enable type-safe programming with parameterized types, allowing developers to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on a range of data types while maintaining type safety at compile time.

### Demo

"*To have a good understanding of what generics do and why they exist, it helps to know the kind of problems that java developpers were running into before generics existed*".

##Â Why Use Generics?

Generics promote code reusability and type safety, improving software quality by reducing the need for explicit type casting and providing compile-time type checking, thereby minimizing runtime errors and enhancing overall robustness.

- **Generic Classes** Generic classes allow the creation of type-generic data structures and algorithms, enabling developers to write reusable components that can work with different types while maintaining type safety and avoiding code duplication.

- **Generic Methods** Generic methods enable writing methods that operate on parameters of any type, allowing the same method to work with different types of data.

- **Type Parameters** Type parameters define the types that a generic class or method can work with.

### Origins of Java Generics

Java generics were introduced in Java 5, which was released in September 2004.

They were inspired by **C++ Templates**:

```C++
#include <iostream>

// Template class for a simple container
template <typename T>
class Container {
private:
    T item;
public:
    Container(T value) : item(value) {}
    void display() {
        std::cout << "Item in container: " << item << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Container<int> intContainer(10);         // Container for int
    Container<std::string> strContainer("Hello"); // Container for string
    intContainer.display();
    strContainer.display();
    return 0;
}
```

### Other Generics

* **Python**: "<small>In Python, generics is a mechanism with which you to define functions, classes, or methods that can operate on multiple types while maintaining type safety. (...) It ensures promoting code flexibility and type correctness. (...) This feature was introduced in Python with version 3.5 onwards."</small>

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_generics.htm

* **TypeScript**: "<small>Generics are a TypeScript feature that allows us to pass in various types of data and create reusable code to handle different inputs. They allow us to define placeholder types which are then replaced when the code is executed with the actual types passed in.</small>"

So good, so far.

### Subtyping

<small>Human is a supertype of Hero</small>

![humans-and-heroes](/images/model/humans-and-heroes.svg)

<small>Hero is a subtype of Human</small>

--

<small>List&lt;Hero&gt; is **NOT** a subtype of List&lt;Human&gt;!</small>

```java
List<Hero> heroes = List.of(new Hero("Achilles"));
List<Human> humans = heroes; // compile-time error

humans.add(new Human("Helen"));
heroes.get(0).getLegend() 
heroes.get(1).getLegend() // ðŸ”¥
```

---

#Â Java Generics

### Subtyping - Wildcards with extends

When creating a List&lt;Human&gt;, Visual Code shows us that the signature for method addAll is:

- boolean java.util.List.addAll(Collection<**? extends Human**> c)

--

```java
List<Hero> heroes = List.of(new Hero("Achilles"));
List<Human> humans = new ArrayList<>();

humans.addAll(heroes);
```

<small>*The phrase "? extends Human" means that it is OK to add all members of a collection with elements of any type that is a subtype of Human.*</small>

---

#Â Java Generics

### Subtyping - Wildcards with extends

<!--
The name 'addAll' is a somehow ambiguous, as there are two lists, and it is not clear which list adds all its element to which other list. Let's invent a method named 'pullFrom' for clarity.
-->

List&lt;Human&gt;.*pullFrom*(Collection<**? extends Human**> c)

```java
List<Hero> heroes = List.of(new Hero("Achilles"));
List<Human> humans = new ArrayList<>();

humans.pullFrom(heroes);
```

---

#Â Java Generics

### Subtyping - Wildcards with extends

List&lt;Human&gt;.*pullFrom*(Collection<**? extends Human**> c) âœ…

Question: What would a '*pushTo*' method look like?

List&lt;Human&gt;.*pushTo*(Collection<**? extends Human**> c) &hellip;?

--

```java
List<Hero> heroes = new ArrayList<>();
List<Human> humans = List.of(new Human("Helen"));

humans.pushTo(heroes); // would compile ok

// ðŸ”¥ Helen is promoted ?!
```

--

List&lt;Human&gt;.*pushTo*(Collection<**? super Human**> c) âœ…

```java
List<Hero> heroes = List.of(new Hero("Achilles"));
List<Human> humans = List.of(new Human("Helen"));
List<Being> beings = new ArrayList<>();

humans.pushTo(heroes); // compile error
humans.pushTo(beings); // fine
heroes.pushTo(beings); // fine
```

#Â Java Generics

### Subtyping - Wildcards

- List&lt;Human&gt;.*pullFrom*(Collection<**? extends Human**> c) âœ…
- List&lt;Human&gt;.*pushTo*(Collection<**? super Human**> c) âœ…

The Get and Put Principle: 

use &lt;**? extends &hellip;**&gt; when you only get values out of a structure, 

use &lt;**? super&hellip;**&gt; when you only put values into a structure, and 

do not use any wildcard when you both get and put.

###Â Type Erasure

--

- Type information is erased at runtime:
    - ```List<Human>``` <small>is transformed into</small> ```List```
- So that generic code can interact seamlessly with non-generic code,
- Still providing compile-time type safety.

--

The compiler generates only one byte code representation of a generic type or method and maps all the instantiations of the generic type or method to the unique representation. This mapping is performed by type erasure.  The essence of type erasure is the removal of all information that is related to type parameters and type arguments. In addition, the compiler adds type checks and type conversions where needed and inserts synthetic bridge methods if necessary. 

It is important to understand type erasure because certain effects related to Java generics are difficult to understand without a proper understanding of the translation process.

###Â Type Erasure

```java
public class TypeErasure {
        static void overloadedMethod(Object o) {
                System.out.println("overloadedMethod(Object) called");
        }

        static void overloadedMethod(String s) {
                System.out.println("overloadedMethod(String) called");
        }

        static void overloadedMethod(Integer i) {
                System.out.println("overloadedMethod(Integer) called");
        }

        static <T> void genericMethod(T t) {
                overloadedMethod(t); // which method is called?
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
                genericMethod("abc");
        }

}
````

Guess what this program prints?

--

```bash
% javac TypeErasure.java && java TypeErasure
overloadedMethod(Object) called
```
