## Overview of Java Language

### Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, strongly typed, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in 1995.

It was designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any device or operating system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.

## Overview of Java Language

### Java Now

Java consistently ranks among the top programming languages globally in terms of popularity and usage, alongside Python and JavaScript, 
according to various surveys and indices like the [TIOBE Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), [Github Octoverse reports](https://octoverse.github.com/2022/top-programming-languages), and [Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#technology-most-popular-technologies).

Java is the primary language for developing Android applications, powering approximately 70% of the global mobile devices market share, according to [several sources](https://www.google.com/search?q=Android+global+mobile+devices+market+share).

## Overview of Java Language

### Key Features
--

- **Object-Oriented**: Java follows an object-oriented programming paradigm, where everything is treated as an object with attributes and methods.
--

- **Platform-Independent**: Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can be executed on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
--

- **Robust and Secure**: Java's strict compile-time and runtime checks help ensure robustness, while its built-in security features protect against common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and memory leaks.
--

- **Multi-threaded**: Java supports multithreading, allowing programs to execute multiple tasks concurrently, enhancing performance and responsiveness.
--

- **Rich Standard Library**: Java comes with a vast standard library (Java API) that provides ready-to-use classes and methods for various tasks, from basic I/O operations to complex data structures and networking functionalities.

### Key Features: Strong Typing vs. Weak Typing

--

**Strong Typing**:
- Strict enforcement of data types.
- Type errors detected at compile-time.
- Examples: **Java**, C#, C/C++, TypeScript.

--

**Weak Typing**:
- Allows more flexibility in variable declaration and type conversions.
- Type errors may not be detected until runtime.
- Examples: Python, JavaScript, PHP.

--

**Bottom line**:
- Strong typing offers type safety but may require more explicit declarations.
- Weak typing provides flexibility but may lead to runtime errors.

## Overview of Java Language

### Key Features: Strong Typing vs. Weak Typing (cont.)

--

**Java**: statically typed (error at compile time)

```java
int myNumber = 10;
myNumber = "Quesadilla";
```
```bash
error: incompatible types: String cannot be converted to int
        myNumber = "Quesadilla";
```

--

**Python**: dynamically typed (error at runtime)

```python
x = "hello"
y = 3 + x
```
```bash
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```

--

**JavaScript**: weakly typed (no errors. Well ... almost!)

```bash
console.log( 3 + "2" )      > 32
console.log( 3 - "2" )      > 1
console.log( 3 * "2" )      > 6
console.log( 3 * "Burger" ) > NaN
```

## Writing Your First Java Program

- Installing Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Configuring IDE (Integrated Development Environment) - Visual Code

<small>More details in [Module 02: Exercises](/index0.html?/exercises/02.md)</small>

Writing Your First Java Program

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

Running Your First Java Program

```bash
$ javac HelloWorld.java
$ java HelloWorld
```
