## Overview of Java Language

### Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, strongly typed, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in 1995.

It was designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java programs can run on any device or operating system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.

## Overview of Java Language

### Key Features

- **Object-Oriented**: Java follows an object-oriented programming paradigm, where everything is treated as an object with attributes and methods.

- **Platform-Independent**: Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can be executed on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

- **Robust and Secure**: Java's strict compile-time and runtime checks help ensure robustness, while its built-in security features protect against common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and memory leaks.

- **Multi-threaded**: Java supports multithreading, allowing programs to execute multiple tasks concurrently, enhancing performance and responsiveness.

- **Rich Standard Library**: Java comes with a vast standard library (Java API) that provides ready-to-use classes and methods for various tasks, from basic I/O operations to complex data structures and networking functionalities.

## Overview of Java Language

### Key Features: Strong Typing vs. Weak Typing

**Strong Typing**:
- Strict enforcement of data types.
- Type errors detected at compile-time.
- Examples: **Java**, C#, C/C++, TypeScript.

**Weak Typing**:
- Allows more flexibility in variable declaration and type conversions.
- Type errors may not be detected until runtime.
- Examples: Python, JavaScript, PHP.

**Bottom line**:
- Strong typing offers type safety but may require more explicit declarations.
- Weak typing provides flexibility but may lead to runtime errors.

---

## Overview of Java Language

### Key Features: Strong Typing vs. Weak Typing (cont.)

**Java**: statically typed (error at compile time)

```java
int myNumber = 10;
myNumber = "Quesadilla";
```
```bash
error: incompatible types: String cannot be converted to int
        myNumber = "Quesadilla";
```

**Python**: dynamically typed (error at runtime)

```python
x = "hello"
y = 3 + x
```
```bash
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```

**JavaScript**: weakly typed (no errors. Well ... almost!)

```bash
console.log( 3 + "2" )      > 32
console.log( 3 - "2" )      > 1
console.log( 3 * "2" )      > 6
console.log( 3 * "Burger" ) > NaN
```

## Basics of Java Syntax

Variables and Data Types

```java
int i = 0; // Primitive
String str = "This is a String"; // Reference
```

**Primitive Data Types**: Represent basic values and are directly supported by the Java language. Examples include `int, long, double, boolean, char`. They hold actual data values.

**Reference Data Types**: Represent complex objects and are created using classes or interfaces. Examples include String, arrays, and user-defined classes. They hold references (memory addresses) to objects rather than actual data values. Unlike primitive types, reference types can be null, meaning they do not refer to any object in memory.

## Basics of Java Syntax

Operators

- arithmetic: `+   -   *   /   %`
- relational: `==   !=   <   >   <=   >=`
- logical: `&&   ||   !`
- bitwise: `&   |   ^   ~`
- array declaration, instantiation, and indexing: `[]`
- ...

Expressions

```java
int num1 = 10;
int num2 = 6;

// arithmetic 
int sum = num1 + num2; // = 16
double quotient = num1 / num2; // = 1
double quotient = num1 / (double) num2; // = 1.6666666666666667 (Cast to double)
// relational 
boolean isEqual = (num1 == num2); // false
// bitwise 
int bitwise_or =  (num1 | num2); // 14: (1010 | 0110) = 1110
// array
int[] fibonacci_numbers = new int[] { 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 };
int fourth_fibonacci_number = fibonacci_numbers[3]; // 2
```

## Understanding Control Flow Structures

If-Else Statements

```java
int age = 20;
if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("You are an adult.");
} else {
    System.out.println("You are a minor.");
}
```

Switch-Case Statements

```java
int day = 3;
String dayName;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        dayName = "Sunday";
        break;
    case 2:
        dayName = "Monday";
        break;
    (...)
    default:
        dayName = "Invalid day";
}
```

## Understanding Control Flow Structures

### Introduction to Collections and Arrays in Java

Arrays
- Arrays are data structures used to store multiple elements of the same type.
- They have a fixed size, which is determined upon declaration.
- Elements in an array are accessed by their index.

```java
// Array Declaration and Initialization with Curly Braces
int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}; // Initialization with values
int num = numbers[2]; // 30
```

Collections
- Collections are objects that group multiple elements into a single unit.
- Collections offer a variety of traversal methods and provide additional data structures such as lists, sets, and maps, offering different memory models and traversal structures compared to arrays.

```java
// Collection Declaration and Initialization with Java Streams
List<String> french_composers = Stream.of("Berlioz", "Debussy", "Ravel", "Manoury").collect(Collectors.toList());
String third = french_composers.get(2); // Ravel
```

---

## Understanding Control Flow Structures

- Loops: For

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
}
```

- Loops: While, Do-While

```java
int count = 0;                                     // Increasing: 0
while (count < 3) {                                // Increasing: 1
    System.out.println("Increasing: " + count++);  // Increasing: 2
}                                                  // Decreasing: 3
do {                                               // Decreasing: 2
    System.out.println("Decreasing: " + count--);  // Decreasing: 1
} while (0 <= count);                              // Decreasing: 0
```

- Loops: Enhanced For

```java
String[] names = {"Kant", "Hegel", "Marx", "Habermas"};
for (String name : names) {
    System.out.println(name);
}
```

- Loops: forEach (Java Collections)

```java
List<String> italianPopFemaleVocalists = Stream.of("Pausini", "Giorgia", "Elisa", "Annalisa").collect(Collectors.toList());

italianPopFemaleVocalists.forEach(name -> System.out.println(name)); // using a lambda function
```

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

### Classes and Objects, Methods and Attributes

**Classes**: Classes are blueprint templates for creating objects. They define the structure and behavior of objects by encapsulating data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data. Classes serve as the foundation for creating multiple objects with similar characteristics.

**Objects**: Objects are instances of classes. They represent real-world entities and possess both state (data/attributes) and behavior (methods). Objects interact with each other by invoking methods and exchanging messages, facilitating communication and collaboration within a program.

```java
class VoidClass {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        // instantiation of an object of class 'Void Class'
        VoidClass voidObject = new VoidClass();
    }
}
```

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

### Classes and Objects, Methods and Attributes

**Methods**: Methods are functions defined within a class that perform specific actions or behaviors. They encapsulate behavior and allow objects to perform operations, manipulate data, and interact with other objects. Methods can have parameters (inputs) and return values (outputs) based on their functionality.

**Attributes**: Attributes, also known as fields or properties, represent the state of an object. They encapsulate data and define the characteristics or properties of an object. Attributes can be of various data types (e.g., int, double, String) and hold values that describe the object's state.

```java
public class NotSoVoidClass {
    final int something;
    public NotSoVoidClass(final int something) {
        this.something = something;
    }
    public String giveMeTheAnswer() {
        return this.something + " is The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.";
    }
    public static void main(String... args) {
        System.out.println(new NotSoVoidClass(42).giveMeTheAnswer());
    }
}
```

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

### Access Modifiers in Java
**Static** [⁽²⁾](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y67pdWHr9Y)
- Used to create variables and methods that belong to the class rather than instances of the class.
- Shared among all instances of the class.
- Can be accessed using the class name.

**Final**
- Used to declare constants, indicating that the value of the variable cannot be changed once assigned.
- Final methods cannot be overridden, and final classes cannot be subclassed.

Access Modifiers for visibility scope
- **Private**: Accessible only within the same class.
- **(no modifier)**: Accessible only within the same package.
- **Protected**: Accessible within the same package and subclasses.
- **Public**: Accessible from anywhere.

# Introduction to Java Programming

### Introduction to Java Standard Library

Java Standard Library, also known as the Java API (Application Programming Interface), is a comprehensive collection of classes and interfaces provided by Java.

It encompasses a wide range of packages covering essential functionalities such as data structures, input/output operations, networking, concurrency, and more.

The Java Standard Library simplifies Java development by offering ready-to-use components and utilities, allowing developers to focus on solving problems rather than reinventing the wheel.

Understanding the Java Standard Library is crucial for Java developers to leverage its vast capabilities and build robust, efficient, and maintainable applications.

## Introduction to Java Programming

### Java Standard Library example: Collections Classes

Java's Collections Framework provides a set of classes and interfaces to handle collections of objects.

Collections classes offer powerful data structures and algorithms to store, manipulate, and access groups of objects efficiently.

Examples of core collections classes include ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, and TreeMap.

## Introduction to Java Programming

### Collections Classes

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class LinkedListExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a LinkedList
        LinkedList<String> linkedList = new LinkedList<>();

        // Adding elements to the LinkedList
        linkedList.add("Java");
        linkedList.add("Python");
        linkedList.add("C++");

        // Displaying the LinkedList
        System.out.println("LinkedList: " + linkedList);

        // Adding an element at the beginning of the LinkedList
        linkedList.addFirst("JavaScript");

        // Adding an element at the end of the LinkedList
        linkedList.addLast("Ruby");

        // Displaying the modified LinkedList
        System.out.println("Modified LinkedList: " + linkedList);

        // Removing the first and last elements from the LinkedList
        linkedList.removeFirst();
        linkedList.removeLast();

        // Displaying the final LinkedList
        System.out.println("Final LinkedList: " + linkedList);
    }
}
```
