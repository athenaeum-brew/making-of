# Java Virtual Threads

---

### What are Java Virtual Threads?

--

Introduced as part of [Project Loom](https://openjdk.org/projects/loom/).

Lightweight threads managed by the JVM.

Aim to simplify concurrent programming and improve performance.

---

### Traditional Threads vs. Virtual Threads

Traditional Threads:

- Managed by the OS.
- Heavyweight, limited by OS resources.
- High memory overhead.

Virtual Threads:

- Managed by the JVM.
- Lightweight, with minimal memory overhead.
- Can create millions of virtual threads without significant performance degradation.

---

### Benefits of Virtual Threads

- Scalability: Handles massive concurrency with ease.
- Resource Efficiency: Lower memory and CPU usage.
- Simplified Concurrency Model: Easier to write, read, and maintain concurrent code.
- Improved Throughput: Higher throughput for I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks.

---

### How Virtual Threads Work

- User-Mode Scheduling: Virtual threads are scheduled by the JVM rather than the OS.
- Continuation Mechanism: Uses continuations to suspend and resume tasks efficiently.
- Lightweight Context Switching: Minimizes the overhead associated with thread context switching.

---

### Creating Virtual Threads

```java

Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
    // Task to be executed
});

```

```java

ExecutorService executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
executor.submit(() -> {
    // Task to be executed
});

```

### Conclusion

Java Virtual Threads are a significant advancement in concurrent programming.

Provide a scalable, efficient, and simpler model for handling concurrency.

Ideal for modern, high-concurrency applications.

### Aftermath: Libraries for Enhanced Concurrency

[Quasar](https://docs.paralleluniverse.co/quasar/)

Quasar, part of the Parallel Universe project, provides lightweight fibers that offer a form of continuation-like behavior.

- Fibers: Lightweight threads that can be suspended and resumed.
- Suspendable Methods: Ability to define suspendable methods using annotations.
- Integration with Existing Code: Can be integrated with existing codebases with minimal changes.

Example Use Cases:

- Asynchronous I/O: Efficiently handle large numbers of concurrent I/O operations.
- Reactive Programming: Write reactive applications with a simplified programming model.
- Coroutine-style Programming: Implement coroutine-style algorithms for improved readability and maintainability.

### Aftermath: Libraries for Enhanced Concurrency

Other Libraries/Frameworks

- Reactor (Project Reactor): A reactive programming library for building non-blocking applications on the JVM.
- Akka (Akka Toolkit): A toolkit for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient applications in Java and Scala.
- Vert.x (Eclipse Vert.x): A toolkit for building reactive and polyglot applications on the JVM.
- Kotlin Coroutines: Kotlin's lightweight concurrency framework for asynchronous programming.

Considerations:

- Learning Curve: Libraries may have a learning curve associated with their specific programming models and APIs.
- Performance: Evaluate performance characteristics and overheads before selecting a library for your application.
- Community and Support: Consider the size and activity of the library's community, as well as the availability of support resources.

### Kotlin

[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is a modern, statically-typed programming language developed by JetBrains, the creators of popular integrated development environments (IDEs) like IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and others. Kotlin was designed to address some of the shortcomings of existing languages like Java and to provide a more concise, safe, and expressive alternative for building applications targeting the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), as well as other platforms such as Android, JavaScript, and Native.

```java
fun main() {
    println("Hello, World!")
}
```

```bash
% kotlinc HelloWorld.kt -include-runtime -d HelloWorld.jar
% java -jar HelloWorld.jar
```

### Kotlin

Key Features of Kotlin:

- Conciseness: Kotlin aims to reduce boilerplate code and improve developer productivity with concise syntax and expressive language features.

- Safety: Kotlin provides a type system that helps catch common programming errors at compile time, reducing the likelihood of runtime exceptions and bugs.

- Interoperability: Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, allowing seamless integration with existing Java codebases and libraries. This makes it easy to adopt Kotlin gradually in projects.

- Null Safety: Kotlin's type system distinguishes between nullable and non-nullable types, reducing the risk of null pointer exceptions (NPEs) at runtime.

- Functional Programming: Kotlin supports functional programming paradigms with features like higher-order functions, lambda expressions, and extension functions.

- Coroutines: Kotlin introduces coroutines, a lightweight concurrency framework, for writing asynchronous and non-blocking code in a sequential style.

- Tooling Support: JetBrains provides excellent tooling support for Kotlin in its IntelliJ IDEA IDE, including code completion, refactoring, and debugging features.

### Kotlin

Use Cases for Kotlin:

- Android Development: Kotlin has gained popularity as an alternative to Java for Android app development due to its concise syntax, null safety, and interoperability with existing Android APIs and libraries.

- Backend Development: Kotlin can be used for server-side development, particularly with frameworks like Spring Boot, Ktor, and Vert.x, offering benefits such as improved developer productivity and safety.

- Web Development: Kotlin can be used for developing web applications with frameworks like Kotlin/JS for client-side development and Ktor for server-side development.

- Desktop and Native Development: Kotlin supports multiplatform development, allowing developers to write shared code for desktop, mobile, and embedded platforms using Kotlin Multiplatform and Kotlin/Native.

Overall, Kotlin offers a modern, pragmatic approach to software development, providing developers with a powerful and expressive language for building a wide range of applications across different platforms. Its growing adoption in the industry and vibrant community support make it an attractive choice for developers looking to enhance their productivity and code quality.
