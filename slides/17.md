# Java Virtual Threads

---

### What are Java Virtual Threads?

Introduced as part of Project Loom.

Lightweight threads managed by the JVM.

Aim to simplify concurrent programming and improve performance.

---

### Traditional Threads vs. Virtual Threads

Traditional Threads:

- Managed by the OS.
- Heavyweight, limited by OS resources.
- High memory overhead.

Virtual Threads:

- Managed by the JVM.
- Lightweight, with minimal memory overhead.
- Can create millions of virtual threads without significant performance degradation.

---

### Benefits of Virtual Threads

- Scalability: Handles massive concurrency with ease.
- Resource Efficiency: Lower memory and CPU usage.
- Simplified Concurrency Model: Easier to write, read, and maintain concurrent code.
- Improved Throughput: Higher throughput for I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks.

---

### How Virtual Threads Work

- User-Mode Scheduling: Virtual threads are scheduled by the JVM rather than the OS.
- Continuation Mechanism: Uses continuations to suspend and resume tasks efficiently.
- Lightweight Context Switching: Minimizes the overhead associated with thread context switching.

### Creating Virtual Threads

```java
Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
    // Task to be executed
});
```

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
executor.submit(() -> {
    // Task to be executed
});

### Conclusion

Java Virtual Threads are a significant advancement in concurrent programming.

Provide a scalable, efficient, and simpler model for handling concurrency.

Ideal for modern, high-concurrency applications.
