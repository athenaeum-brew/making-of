## Basics of Java Syntax

Variables and Data Types

```java
int i = 0; // Primitive
String str = "This is a String"; // Reference
```

**Primitive Data Types**: Represent basic values and are directly supported by the Java language. Examples include `int, long, double, boolean, char`. They hold actual data values.

**Reference Data Types**: Represent complex objects and are created using classes or interfaces. Examples include String, arrays, and user-defined classes. They hold references (memory addresses) to objects rather than actual data values. Unlike primitive types, reference types can be null, meaning they do not refer to any object in memory.

Operators

- arithmetic: `+   -   *   /   %`
- relational: `==   !=   <   >   <=   >=`
- logical: `&&   ||   !`
- bitwise: `&   |   ^   ~`
- array declaration, instantiation, and indexing: `[]`
- ...

Expressions

```java
int num1 = 10;
int num2 = 6;

// arithmetic 
int sum = num1 + num2; // = 16
double quotient = num1 / num2; // = 1
double quotient = num1 / (double) num2; // = 1.6666666666666667 (Cast to double)
// relational 
boolean isEqual = (num1 == num2); // false
// bitwise 
int bitwise_or =  (num1 | num2); // 14: (1010 | 0110) = 1110
// array
int[] fibonacci_numbers = new int[] { 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 };
int fourth_fibonacci_number = fibonacci_numbers[3]; // 2
```

If-Else Statements

```java
int age = 20;
if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("You are an adult.");
} else {
    System.out.println("You are a minor.");
}
```

Switch-Case Statements

```java
int day = 3;
String dayName;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        dayName = "Sunday";
        break;
    case 2:
        dayName = "Monday";
        break;
    (...)
    default:
        dayName = "Invalid day";
}
```

### Introduction to Collections and Arrays in Java

Arrays
- Arrays are data structures used to store multiple elements of the same type.
- They have a fixed size, which is determined upon declaration.
- Elements in an array are accessed by their index.

```java
// Array Declaration and Initialization with Curly Braces
int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}; // Initialization with values
int num = numbers[2]; // 30
```

Collections
- Collections are objects that group multiple elements into a single unit.
- Collections offer a variety of traversal methods and provide additional data structures such as lists, sets, and maps, offering different memory models and traversal structures compared to arrays.

```java
// Collection Declaration and Initialization with Java Streams
List<String> french_composers = Stream.of("Berlioz", "Debussy", "Ravel", "Manoury").collect(Collectors.toList());
String third = french_composers.get(2); // Ravel
```

## Understanding Control Flow Structures

- Loops: For

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
}
```

- Loops: While, Do-While

```java
int count = 0;                                     // Increasing: 0
while (count < 3) {                                // Increasing: 1
    System.out.println("Increasing: " + count++);  // Increasing: 2
}                                                  // Decreasing: 3
do {                                               // Decreasing: 2
    System.out.println("Decreasing: " + count--);  // Decreasing: 1
} while (0 <= count);                              // Decreasing: 0
```

- Loops: Enhanced For

```java
String[] names = {"Kant", "Hegel", "Marx", "Habermas"};
for (String name : names) {
    System.out.println(name);
}
```

- Loops: forEach (Java Collections)

```java
List<String> italianPopFemaleVocalists = Stream.of("Pausini", "Giorgia", "Elisa", "Annalisa").collect(Collectors.toList());

italianPopFemaleVocalists.forEach(name -> System.out.println(name)); // using a lambda function
```

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

### Classes and Objects, Methods and Attributes

**Classes**: Classes are blueprint templates for creating objects. They define the structure and behavior of objects by encapsulating data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data. Classes serve as the foundation for creating multiple objects with similar characteristics.

**Objects**: Objects are instances of classes. They represent real-world entities and possess both state (data/attributes) and behavior (methods). Objects interact with each other by invoking methods and exchanging messages, facilitating communication and collaboration within a program.

```java
class VoidClass {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        // instantiation of an object of class 'Void Class'
        VoidClass voidObject = new VoidClass();
    }
}
```

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

### Classes and Objects, Methods and Attributes

**Methods**: Methods are functions defined within a class that perform specific actions or behaviors. They encapsulate behavior and allow objects to perform operations, manipulate data, and interact with other objects. Methods can have parameters (inputs) and return values (outputs) based on their functionality.

**Attributes**: Attributes, also known as fields or properties, represent the state of an object. They encapsulate data and define the characteristics or properties of an object. Attributes can be of various data types (e.g., int, double, String) and hold values that describe the object's state.

```java
public class NotSoVoidClass {
    final int something;
    public NotSoVoidClass(final int something) {
        this.something = something;
    }
    public String giveMeTheAnswer() {
        return this.something + " is The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.";
    }
    public static void main(String... args) {
        System.out.println(new NotSoVoidClass(42).giveMeTheAnswer());
    }
}
```

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

### Access Modifiers in Java
**Static** [⁽²⁾](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y67pdWHr9Y)
- Used to create variables and methods that belong to the class rather than instances of the class.
- Shared among all instances of the class.
- Can be accessed using the class name.

**Final**
- Used to declare constants, indicating that the value of the variable cannot be changed once assigned.
- Final methods cannot be overridden, and final classes cannot be subclassed.

Access Modifiers for visibility scope
- **Private**: Accessible only within the same class.
- **(no modifier)**: Accessible only within the same package.
- **Protected**: Accessible within the same package and subclasses.
- **Public**: Accessible from anywhere.
