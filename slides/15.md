# Introduction to Concurrency

#### What are the difference between parallel, concurrent, asynchronous and multithreaded programming?

--

**Parallel** programming involves dividing a problem into sub-problems, solving them simultaneously on multiple processors or cores, and then combining the results.

--

**Concurrent** programming involves structuring a program to handle multiple tasks that can make progress independently. These tasks might not run simultaneously but are designed to run independently.

--

**Asynchronous** programming involves executing tasks that can start, run, and complete in the background without blocking the main thread of execution.

--

**Multithreaded** programming involves creating multiple threads within a single process to perform tasks concurrently, with each thread running independently but sharing the same memory space.
